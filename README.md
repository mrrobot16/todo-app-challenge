# Todo List Challenge
The Todo List Challenge is to build a simple web application that allows users to maintain a list of tasks.

### What you'll build

#### New Todo Component
In this component we expect having an input where we create a new todo

#### Todo List Component
In this component we expect having list of todos that fetched from your server.

#### Todo List Actions Component
In this component we expect having the following actions: 
- Edit a Todo.
- Mark a Todo as completed
- Mark a Todo as not-completed
- Delete a Todo.

#### Tech Stack requirements

- Client-side: React
- Perfect stylings are not needed, however avoid at all cost using a CSS Framework. Plain CSS is welcome. Again it does not have to be perfect. 
- Server-side: Node.js preferably something like [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) or [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).
- Database: Feel free to use any type of database. MongoDB or any SQL database is welcomed.

#### Deployment
Use [heroku](heroku.com) to host ui and server

#### Submission 

Create a repo in github, add a README.MD explaining how to run the application locally. 

#### Bonus

Write something about yourself, something that can give us an idea of who you are, what you believe, why you do what you do and where do you see yourself in 5 years.
